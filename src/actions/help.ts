**Gracoon** aims to become a tool for collaborating online on graph theoretical problems.
While it is still under developpement, the basic functionnalities (draw graphs and share the link to collaborate) work.
Some basic *parameters* and graph *generators* are already incorporated but we want to add more of them and also let the user code its own parameter.

This tool could be also used for a presentation or for educationnal purpose.

You can submit ideas or issues on the <a href="https://github.com/lucas-test/gracoon-client">github repository</a> or by mail.

## Boards

Boards are permanent. 
To share a board, share the url or click on the <img src="public/img/icons/share.svg" class="help" /> icon to copy the link.



## Functionalities / Modes

In any mode, move the camera by dragging the cursor while holding down the right mouse button.

<img src="public/img/icons/selection.svg" class="help" />
Move and select elements. 
To select all elements in a rectangle, click on the board and describe a rectangle while keeping the CTRL key pressed.
To select a connected component of the (undirected) graph, click on a vertex while keeping the SHIFT key â‡§ pressed.
By moving a vertex over another vertex, it will merge them.

Add vertices and edges or arcs with <img src="public/img/icons/edition.svg" class="help"/> <img src="public/img/icons/arc.svg" class="help"/>. 
Use CTRL key to create paths easily.
By creating a vertex over an edge or an arc, it will subdivide the link in two.

Edges and arcs are by default rectilinear. 
To bend them, use the "control point" mode <img src="public/img/icons/control_point.svg" class="help" /> by clicking on an edge.
Use CTRL key to force the control point to be on the metdiator of the extremities of the link.
To revert the edge/arc rectilinear, click on the link to delete the control point.


<img src="public/img/icons/area.svg" class="help" />
An area is a rectangular zone on the board that is used for computing parameters only for the subgraph contained within it.


<img src="public/img/icons/text.svg" class="help"/> 
Add a text zone on the board by clicking on the board.
Text zones support LaTeX and Markdown.
Add weights on the edges/arcs/vertices of the graph by clicking on them.


The options <img src="public/img/icons/index_number_unstable.svg" class="help"/>  <img src="public/img/icons/index_number_stable.svg" class="help"/> show the indices of the vertices. Their indices are either stable <img src="public/img/icons/index_number_stable.svg" class="help"/> or unstable <img src="public/img/icons/index_number_unstable.svg" class="help"/> to vertices deletions. If they are unstable, then they are between 0 and n-1 (where n is the number of vertices of the graph).


## Parameters

Add a parameter on the whole graph or only on the subgraph induced by an area by clicking on the + button.
Most of the parameters are recomputed at each modification of the graph.
Parameters with a too high complexity are updated only by clicking on the <img src="public/img/parametor/reload.svg"  style="filter: invert(1); background-color: black" class="help" /> button.

### Certificate

Most of parameters can show a certificate once the parameter has been computed.
Vertices in the certificate have a circle around them.
Links in the certificate are thicker.

Only one parameter can be verbose simultaneously. 
Click on <img src="public/img/parametor/verbose.svg" style="filter: invert(1); background-color: black" class="help"/> to select the certificate you want to see.



## Todo

- the user can code its own parameter, interactor, generator ...
- a lot of little things (loops, multi edge)
